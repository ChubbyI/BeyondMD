This is mostly a personal project and as such some code might not be working at the time you run it as it is still being developed. I start things and tend to not finish at times. Also some code is written in a way you have to enter ypur own variables in order for it to run (mainly th eterraform scripts).

However, 
I will still  love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (I will use Github Flow). I actively welcome your pull requests:

- Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
- If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
- Ensure the test suite passes.
- Make sure your code lints.
- Issue that pull request!
